Meeting Summary: Jan 29, 2021
---------------------------------

- Discussion: We discussed the paper: `Longitudinal double-spin asymmetry for inclusive jet and dijet production in polarized proton collisions at CM Energy = 200 GeV` as the institutional reviewer.

- Presentations: Check presentations on `Meson Elliptic Flow` by Ding and `p elliptic flow v2` by Yang posted [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fquu9bgqctn_CDZJYJawn3ul5i57338c) 

- Ananya:

- Cameron: Running 3 GeV analysis with full file list, updated centrality, updated bad run list, and some updated plots. I’ll get v_2 and v_3, but this will take some time.

- David:

- Ding: This week I am taking Owl shifts. Working on the v2 of phi-meson using Psi_2

- Erik:

- Latif: Worked on cut comparison with Zhanwen’s analysis. Generated inclusive pion A_N samples to further benchmark the result.

- Liankun:

- William:

- Xilin:

- Yang:
